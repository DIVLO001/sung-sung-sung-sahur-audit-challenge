## Reflection

This challenge taught us the importance of semantic HTML, clean CSS, and proper project organization.  
By working as a team, we learned how to audit code, identify issues, and implement best practices for accessibility and responsiveness.  
We also gained practical experience with GitHub workflows, committing changes gradually and collaborating effectively.  
Overall, this was a great exercise in improving code quality while maintaining teamwork and version control discipline.
