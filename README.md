# ACTIVITY 2

🔹 Frozen Throne Audit Challenge

🔹 Description
This project is a frontend refactoring effort created as part of the "Frontend Code Audit & Refactor Challenge" by our team (LUSTRE, VIZON, MACABUDBUD, PON). It is designed to transform a previously broken website template into a fully responsive, semantic, and organized web application. The primary purpose was to identify code errors, restructure file organization, and ensure cross-browser compatibility for the landing, login, and signup pages.

🔹 Technologies Used
 HTML5
 CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)
 GitHub (Version Control)

🔹 Features
 Functional Authentication Pages: Fully linked and styled Login and Signup forms.
 Responsive Refactor: A mobile-friendly layout achieved by rewriting the CSS using Flexbox and Grid.
 Optimized File Structure: A reorganized repository with separated assets for images, CSS, and HTML to improve maintainability.

🔹 AI Assistance Disclosure (Required)
Did you use AI tools? Yes

Details:
We used AI to identify specific errors within the broken website template. We followed its exact instructions to debug the HTML/CSS issues and utilized its guidance to restructure the code and files correctly.

🔹 Learning Reflection (Short)
This challenge taught us the importance of semantic HTML, clean CSS, and proper project organization for accessibility. The most challenging part was managing GitHub workflows as a team to commit changes gradually without causing merge conflicts.
